Polymorphism
=====

Polymorphism allows Ohm models to be derived from, subclassed and specialized. Subclasses of an Ohm model may add attributes, collections and indices to the root model. When the root is queried using `find`, a polymorphic collection of subclasses of the root class is returned.

### Example

    class User < Ohm::Model
      polymorphic(true)
      attribute :name
      index :name
    end

    class SuperUser < User
      attribute :kernel
      index :kernel
    end

Here `SuperUser` derives from `User` and adds the indexed attribute `kernel`. The line `polymorphic(true)` flags the model `User` as the root of a polymorphic tree of model classes.

## Model Root 

All models that have subclasses are deemed polymorphic. The model `root` is the superclass of all its polymorphs. The `roots` are your application classes that derive from `Ohm::Model`:

    >> User.root
    => User
    >> SuperUser.root
    => User

    >> User.create( name:'jojo' )
    => #<User:1 name="jojo">
    >> SuperUser.create( name:'lenny', kernel:'debian' )
    => #<SuperUser:2 name="lenny" kernel="debian">
    
The `all` collection for the model root contains all subclasses of the root:

    >> User.all.map(&:name)
    => ["jojo", "lenny"]
    >> User.all.map(&:class)
    => [User, SuperUser]

Whereas the subclass `all` collections contain only objects of that subclass and its descendants:

    >> SuperUser.all.map(&:name)
    => ["lenny"]

In effect, we persist a hidden `_type` attribute with all subclass instances, and `Subclass.all` is the name of the index on `_type`.

## Finding Subclasses

When you perform a `find`, you specify the model `root` or the first descendant that has all of the indices that you are searching on:

    >> User.find( name:'lenny' ).first
    => #<SuperUser:2 name="lenny" kernel="debian">
    >> SuperUser.find( kernel:'debian' ).first
    => #<SuperUser:2 name="lenny" kernel="debian">
    
    >> User.find( kernel:'centos' )
    => Ohm::Model::IndexNotFound  # error    

## Setting the Base Class

What if your model roots derive from a common application base class, `ModelBase`, rather than `Ohm::Model`? You set the base class like this:

    class ModelBase < Ohm::Model
      self.base = self
    end
    
    class User < ModelBase; ... end
    class SuperUser < User; ... end
